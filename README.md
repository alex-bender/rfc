## Repository purpose

So what for do I need this repo?  
The reason for which the repo is being developed is pretty simple:  
I'd like a place where I can write down some thoughts or draft versions of any idea, which should be discussed with the group of people.
Usually proposals should be well discussed before they get ratified and sometimes it is hard to focus on some details of the proposal during
live chat discussions -- that's why I've created this repository -- to have the ability easily cite any part of proposal.

## Status of the repo

It's a live and fluid system, without any strong defined structure and with bugs (flaws, mistakes and suchlike), but I'm gonna do my best to get rid of it.

## TOC

* index page: 001-hab-index-page.md

  Whole that repo was inspired by chat with awesome habi-people at their slack channel about perfect index page design\behaviour;
  In this rfc I'm trying to define and sublime all what could be helpful for implementing, or at least taking into account during inmpementation of index page design.

## Workflow

[WIP] Describe rfc lifecycle

## Side effects

I expect that writing this kind of stuff and maintaining this repo will likely help me develop my technical writing \ requirement specification skills.
